===================

Lingoes Dictionary File LD2/LDX Reader. Written in C++(Qt).

_Note: This is a console application without Qt GUI._

##### LICENSED UNDER GPLv3 ######


### Ultimate Goal

Make a fast LD2/LDX reader plugin for kdictionary.

### Current Status

**All functions** of the [original Java code](https://code.google.com/p/dict4cn/source/browse/trunk/importer/src/LingoesLd2Reader.java) are ported well.

Only core code of this project will be merged in kdictionary project.

This project will continue to be independent afterwards.
